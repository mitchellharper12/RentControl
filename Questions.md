 * How are schools funded?
 * Who defines imputed rent?
 * Why do I feel deep down that everyone who says rent control is bad thinks that developers
   who allocate rental versus condo apportionment are amoral actors rather than selfish actors?
 * If rents are set at a rate that allow a landlord to not lose money by renting property, why
   would rent control have any affect on housing allocation decisions? If it does, what is the
   need for that causality chain?
 * Shouldn't we just build more housing?
 * Tokyo is doing fine without rent control, why not be like Tokyo?
 * If the landlords are setting the rent too high, why not have a land value tax instead?
 * What affects would rent control have on family stability and fertility desires/outcomes?
 * Why not just give cash subsidies over rent control?
 * Why not just do land value control instead of rent control? Can't you achieve the goals
   of rent control with land value control and first right of refusal by municipalities
   on land sales? Actually, isn't that what Singapore did?
